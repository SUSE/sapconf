# sapconf
The utility adjusts operating system parameters, such as kernel tuning settings and resource limits, to allow running various SAP solutions at satisfactory performance.

The utility has been offered with SLES 11, SLES 12, as well as SLES4SAP 11 and 12. It continues to be supported and actively maintained on all of the SLES/SLES4SAP versions. However, with the SP2 release of SLES4SAP 12 (not SLES), the utility is deprecated in favour of [saptune](https://github.com/SUSE/saptune).
