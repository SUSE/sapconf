# /sys/kernel/mm/ksm/run
# Kernel Samepage Merging (KSM). KSM allows for an application to register with
# the kernel so as to have its memory pages merged with other processes that
# also register to have their pages merged. For KVM the KSM mechanism allows
# for guest virtual machines to share pages with each other. In todays
# environment where many of the guest operating systems like XEN, KVM are
# similar and are running on same host machine, this can result in significant
# memory savings. Default value is 0.

# /proc/sys/kernel/numa_balancing
# Enables/disables automatic page fault based NUMA memory balancing.
# Memory is moved automatically to nodes that access it often.
# Enables/disables automatic NUMA memory balancing. On NUMA machines, there
# is a performance penalty if remote memory is accessed by a CPU. When this
# feature is enabled the kernel samples what task thread is accessing memory
# by periodically unmapping pages and later trapping a page fault. At the
# time of the page fault, it is determined if the data being accessed should
# be migrated to a local memory node.
# The unmapping of pages and trapping faults incur additional overhead that
# ideally is offset by improved memory locality but there is no universal
# guarantee. If the target workload is already bound to NUMA nodes then this
# feature should be disabled. Otherwise, if the system overhead from the
# feature is too high then the rate the kernel samples for NUMA hinting
# faults may be controlled by the numa_balancing_scan_period_min_ms,
# numa_balancing_scan_delay_ms, numa_balancing_scan_period_max_ms,
# numa_balancing_scan_size_mb, and numa_balancing_settle_count sysctls.

# [cpu] governor setting
# performance related setting in tuned.conf
#
# CPU Frequency/Voltage scaling (applies to Intel-based systems only)
# The clock frequency and voltage of modern CPUs can scale, in order to save
# energy when there’s less work to be done. However HANA as a high-performance
# database benefits from high CPU frequencies.

# [cpu] /dev/cpu_dma_frequency setting
# performance related setting in tuned.conf
#
# force latency (applies to Intel-based systems only)
#
# The [cpu] section in tuned.conf dynamically changes the PM QoS CPU DMA latency
# according to the CPU load. If the CPU load is lower than the value specified
# by the load_threshold parameter, the latency is set to the value specified by
# the latency_high parameter, otherwise it is set to value specified by
# latency_low.
# To switch off these dynamically changes the latency can be forced to a
# specific value. This can be accomplished by setting the force_latency
# parameter to the required latency value.
# Such a 'static' setting may make the OS more predictable
#
# Value is set to 70
#
# SAP Note 2205917
#
#force_latency = 70

# [cpu] Intel P-State driver setting
# performance related setting in tuned.conf
#
# min_perf_pct (applies to Intel-based systems only and
#               only if Intel-P-State-Driver is used)
# The P-State driver provides its own sysfs files to control the P-State
# selection. These files have been added to /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate
# Any changes made to these files are applicable to all CPUs
#
# min_perf_pct: Limits the minimum P-State that will be requested by the driver.
# It states it as a percentage of the max (non-turbo) performance level.
#
# Value is commented out by default
#
# SAP Note
#
#min_perf_pct = 100

# [disk] I/O scheduler
#
# The default I/O scheduler for SLES is CFQ. It offers satisfactory performance
# for wide range of I/O task, however choosing an alternative scheduler may
# potentially yield better latency characteristics and throughput.
# "noop" is an alternative scheduler, in comparison to CFQ it may offer more
# consistent performance, lower computation overhead, and potentially higher
# throughput.
#
# For most SAP environments (RAID, storage arrays, virtualizaton) 'noop' is the
# better choice.
# Value is set to 'noop'
#
# When set, all block devices on the system will be switched to the chosen
# scheduler.
