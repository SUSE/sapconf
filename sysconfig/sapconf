# vm.dirty_bytes (indirect vm.dirty_ratio)
# Contains the amount of dirty memory at which a process generating disk writes

# Note: dirty_bytes is the counterpart of dirty_ratio. Only one of them may be

# account to evaluate the dirty memory limits and the other appears as 0 when
# read.
# Note: when switching off (stopping) sapconf, both values will be set back to
# their previous settings.
# Note: the minimum value allowed for dirty_bytes is two pages (in bytes); any
# value lower than this limit will be ignored and the old configuration will be
# retained.

# net.ipv4.tcp_slow_start_after_idle
# If enabled (=1), provide RFC 2861 behavior and time out the congestion
# window after an idle period. An idle period is defined as the current
# RTO (retransmission timeout). If disabled (=0), the congestion window will
# not be timed out after an idle period.

# This value is important for large ScaleOut HANA clusters and HANA2 in general.

# /sys/kernel/mm/ksm/run
# Kernel Samepage Merging (KSM). KSM allows for an application to register with
# the kernel so as to have its memory pages merged with other processes that
# also register to have their pages merged. For KVM the KSM mechanism allows
# for guest virtual machines to share pages with each other. In todays
# environment where many of the guest operating systems like XEN, KVM are
# similar and are running on same host machine, this can result in significant
# memory savings. Default value is 0.

# /proc/sys/kernel/numa_balancing
# Enables/disables automatic page fault based NUMA memory balancing.
# Memory is moved automatically to nodes that access it often.
# Enables/disables automatic NUMA memory balancing. On NUMA machines, there
# is a performance penalty if remote memory is accessed by a CPU. When this
# feature is enabled the kernel samples what task thread is accessing memory
# by periodically unmapping pages and later trapping a page fault. At the
# time of the page fault, it is determined if the data being accessed should
# be migrated to a local memory node.
# The unmapping of pages and trapping faults incur additional overhead that
# ideally is offset by improved memory locality but there is no universal
# guarantee. If the target workload is already bound to NUMA nodes then this
# feature should be disabled. Otherwise, if the system overhead from the
# feature is too high then the rate the kernel samples for NUMA hinting
# faults may be controlled by the numa_balancing_scan_period_min_ms,
# numa_balancing_scan_delay_ms, numa_balancing_scan_period_max_ms,
# numa_balancing_scan_size_mb, and numa_balancing_settle_count sysctls.

# Energy Performance Bias EPB (applies to Intel-based systems only)
#
# we renamed the parameter to PERF_BIAS to make a clear distinction to
# the former used tuned.conf parameter 'energy_perf_bias'
#
# PERF_BIAS: performance - 0, normal - 6, powersave - 15
# or any number between 0 and 15
#
# SAP Note 2684254
#
# setting is disabled by default (leave empty)
# When set, for all cpus the energy performance bias setting will be switched
# to the chosen value.
# if activating performance related settings a recommended value for
# Energy Performance Bias is 'performance' or '0'
#
PERF_BIAS=

# CPU Frequency/Voltage scaling (applies to Intel-based systems only)
#
# we renamed the parameter to GOVERNOR to make a clear distinction to
# the former used tuned.conf parameter 'governor'
#
# The clock frequency and voltage of modern CPUs can scale, in order to save
# energy when thereâ€™s less work to be done. However HANA as a high-performance
# database benefits from high CPU frequencies.
# governor: performance , powersave
#
# SAP Note 2684254
#
# setting is disabled by default (leave empty)
# When set, for all cpus the scaling governor setting will be switched to the
# chosen value.
# if activating performance related settings a recommended value for
# governor is 'performance'
#
GOVERNOR=

# force latency - configure C-States for lower latency
# (applies to Intel-based systems only)
#
# we renamed the parameter to FORCE_LATENCY to make a clear distinction to
# the former used tuned.conf parameter 'force_latency'
#
# Input is a string, which is internally treated as a decimal (not a
# hexadecimal) integer number representing a maximum response time in
# microseconds.
# It is used to establish a latency upper limit by limiting the use of C-States
# (CPU idle or CPU latency states) to only those with an exit latency smaller
# than the value set here. That means only those states that require less than
# the requested number of microseconds to wake up are enabled, all the other
# C-States are disabled.
#
# The files /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpuidle/state*/latency and
# /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpuidle/state*/disable are used to limit the
# C-States.
#
# When set in the sysconfig file
# for all available CPUs all CPU latency states with a value read from
# /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpuidle/state*/latency >= (higher than)
# the value from the sysconfig file are disabled by writing '1' to
# /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpuidle/state*/disable
#
# ATTENTION: not idling *at all* increases power consumption significantly and
# reduces the life span of the machine because of wear and tear. So do not use
# a too strict latency setting. For SAP HANA workloads a value of '70'
# microseconds (as a "light sleep") seems to be sufficient. And the impact on
# power consumption and life of the CPUs is less severe. But don't forget: The
# deeper the idle state, the larger is the exit latency.
#
# SAP Note 2684254
#
# if activating performance related settings a recommended value for
# force latency to start with is 70
#
FORCE_LATENCY=70

# Intel P-State driver setting
# (applies to Intel-based systems only and only if Intel-P-State-Driver is used)
#
# we renamed the parameter to MIN_PERF_PCT to make a clear distinction to
# the former used tuned.conf parameter 'min_perf_pct'
#
# The P-State driver provides its own sysfs files to control the P-State
# selection. These files have been added to /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate
# Any changes made to these files are applicable to all CPUs
#
# min_perf_pct: Limits the minimum P-State that will be requested by the driver.
# It states it as a percentage of the max (non-turbo) performance level.
#
# SAP Note 2684254
#
# setting is disabled by default (leave empty)
# if activating performance related settings a recommended value for
# MIN_PERF_PCT to start with is 100
#
MIN_PERF_PCT=

# disk I/O scheduler
#
# we renamed the parameter to IO_SCHEDULER to make a clear distinction to
# the former used tuned.conf parameter 'elevator'
#
# The default I/O scheduler for single-queued block layer devices offers
# satisfactory performance for wide range of I/O task, however choosing an
# alternative scheduler may potentially yield better latency characteristics
# and throughput.
# "noop" is an alternative scheduler, in comparison to other schedulers it
# may offer more consistent performance, lower computation overhead, and
# potentially higher throughput.
# For most SAP environments (RAID, storage arrays, virtualizaton) 'noop' is
# the better choice.
# With the new introduced multi-queue scheduler for block layer devices the
# recommended I/O scheduler is 'none' as an equivalent to 'noop' for
# single-queued block layer devices.
#
# So IO_SCHEDULER can now contain a list of possible schedulers, separated
# by blanks, which are checked from left to right. The first one which is
# available in /sys/block/<device>/queue/scheduler will be used as new
# scheduler setting for the respective block device.
#
# When set, all block devices on the system will be switched to one of the
# chosen schedulers.
#
# SAP Note 2578899
#
IO_SCHEDULER="noop none"
