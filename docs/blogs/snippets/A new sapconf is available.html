Those who administrate systems running SAP applications on SLES may be already familiar with the configuration and tuning tool "sapconf".
For those who don't, now is an excellent time to do so!

A new improved version of sapconf has been released for SLES 12 SP1 onwards.
Some key improvements are:
<ul>
 	<li>one central configuration file (besides the tuned config)</li>
 	<li>Simplified and adjusted configuration based on current SAP notes</li>
 	<li>Unified sap-hana and sap-netweaver profiles to simplify deployment</li>
 	<li>Improved documentation</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

So it is worth to update or install it.

Here the minimal versions for the reworked sapconf:
<p>
	4.1.12-40.47.1 (SLES 12 SP3)<br />
	4.1.12-33.15.1 (SLES 12 SP2)<br />
	4.1.12-18.24.1 (SLES 12 SP1)<br />
</p>

I wrote a blog post series about how to install, update and configure the new sapconf, as well as giving a few tips what you should look out for and how to achieve certain things:
