.SH NAME
sapconf \- central configuration file of sapconf

.SH DESCRIPTION
This man page documents format and content of the central configuration file of sapconf.
.br
The \fI/etc/sysconfig/sapconf\fR file uses the sysconfig\-file format.
.br
The file consists of 3 parts. The first part contains all parameters that can be set for the system tuning profiles of sapconf(7) using the configuration file /etc/sysconfig/sapconf. The second and third one is only for documentation purpose.
.PP
In the file you can find the actual recommended value, the source SAP Note, a short explanation and where this parameter is set.
.br
If you change parameter values please don't forget to restart sapconf service to get the changes take effect.
.PP
The package installation of sapconf will have regard for changes made to /etc/sysconfig/sapconf. In some cases the old configuration file is preserved as /etc/sysconfig/sapconf.rpmsave and the new sapconf sysconfig file is copied to /etc/sysconfig/sapconf. Please make sure that you merge needed changes from this file to the new /etc/sysconfig/sapconf file before you restart the sapconf service.

.SH DESCRIPTION OF PART 1

Contains the amount of dirty memory at which a process generating disk writes will itself start writeback.

Note: \fBvm.dirty_bytes\fP is the counterpart of \fBvm.dirty_ratio\fP. Only one of them may be specified at a time. When one sysctl is written it is immediately taken into account to evaluate the dirty memory limits and the other appears as 0 when read.

.BI TCP_SLOW_START=0
If enabled (=1), provide RFC 2861 behavior and time out the congestion window after an idle period. An idle period is defined as the current RTO (retransmission timeout). If disabled (=0), the congestion window will not be timed out after an idle period.
.br
This value is important for large ScaleOut HANA clusters and HANA2 in general. So disable TCP slow start on idle connections

.BI KSM=0
Kernel Samepage Merging (KSM). KSM allows for an application to register with the kernel so as to have its memory pages merged with other processes that also register to have their pages merged. For KVM the KSM mechanism allows for guest virtual machines to share pages with each other. In todays environment where many of the guest operating systems like XEN, KVM are similar and are running on same host machine, this can result in significant memory savings. Default value is 0.

.BI NUMA_BALANCING=0
Enables/disables automatic page fault based NUMA memory balancing. Memory is moved automatically to nodes that access it often. On NUMA machines, there is a performance penalty if remote memory is accessed by a CPU. When this feature is enabled the kernel samples what task thread is accessing memory by periodically unmapping pages and later trapping a page fault. At the time of the page fault, it is determined if the data being accessed should be migrated to a local memory node. The unmapping of pages and trapping faults incur additional overhead that ideally is offset by improved memory locality but there is no universal guarantee. If the target workload is already bound to NUMA nodes then this feature should be disabled. Otherwise, if the system overhead from the feature is too high then the rate the kernel samples for NUMA hinting faults may be controlled by the numa_balancing_scan_period_min_ms, numa_balancing_scan_delay_ms, numa_balancing_scan_period_max_ms, numa_balancing_scan_size_mb, and numa_balancing_settle_count sysctls.

The clock frequency and voltage of modern CPUs can scale, in order to save energy when there’s less work to be done. However HANA as a high-performance database benefits from high CPU frequencies.

.BI "force_latency = 70"
force latency (applies to Intel-based systems only)
.br
The [cpu] section in tuned.conf dynamically changes the PM QoS CPU DMA latency according to the CPU load. If the CPU load is lower than the value specified by the load_threshold parameter, the latency is set to the value specified by the latency_high parameter, otherwise it is set to value specified by latency_low.
.br
To switch off these dynamically changes the latency can be forced to a specific value. This can be accomplished by setting the force_latency parameter to the required latency value. Such a 'static' setting may make the OS more predictable

[cpu] /dev/cpu_dma_frequency setting - performance related setting in tuned.conf

.BI "#min_perf_pct = 100"
min_perf_pct (applies to Intel-based systems only and only if Intel-P-State-Driver is used)
.br
The P-State driver provides its own sysfs files to control the P-State selection. These files have been added to /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate. Any changes made to these files are applicable to all CPUs
.br
min_perf_pct: Limits the minimum P-State that will be requested by the driver. It states it as a percentage of the max (non-turbo) performance level.

.BI "elevator = noop"
[disk] I/O scheduler - IO related setting in tuned.conf
.br
The default I/O scheduler for SLES is CFQ. It offers satisfactory performance for wide range of I/O task, however choosing an alternative scheduler may potentially yield better latency characteristics and throughput.
.br
"noop" is an alternative scheduler, in comparison to CFQ it may offer more consistent performance, lower computation overhead, and potentially higher throughput. For most SAP environments (RAID, storage arrays, virtualizaton) "noop" is the better choice.
.br
When set, all block devices on the system will be switched to the chosen scheduler.

.BI USERTASKSMAX=infinity
The file \fB/etc/systemd/logind.conf.d/sap.conf\fP configures a parameter of the systemd login manager. It sets the maximum number of OS tasks each user may run concurrently. The behaviour of the systemd login manager was changed starting SLES12SP2 to prevent fork bomb attacks. So no need to set in SLES12SP1.
.br
The file will be created during package installation, if it does not already exists.
.br
Note: A reboot is needed after the first setup to get the change take effect.
A message will indicate if a reboot is necessary.
.br
There is no rollback.
